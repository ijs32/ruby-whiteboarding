This folder is devoted to working through the algorithm ladder found at the following link: https://trello.com/b/smxNsfu6/algorithm-ladder

I will be dividing each section into separate folders and each problem into separate files within said folders to make navigating this directory and following along very simple!

this is a direct copy of my python whiteboarding directory, I ran a script to add the .rb script instead of remaking everything
